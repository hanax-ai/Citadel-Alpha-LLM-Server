# Install Web Framework Dependencies

Install all FastAPI and related web framework dependencies using the pinned requirements file for reproducible builds:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/web.txt
```

This requirements file includes:
- **FastAPI ecosystem**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Starlette, Pydantic
- **Server utilities**: Gunicorn, HTTP clients, file handling
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus client, OpenTelemetry
- **All sub-dependencies**: Pinned for complete reproducibility

For development or testing with latest versions, you can use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/web.txt --upgrade
```

**Note**: The requirements file uses exact version pinning (==) to ensure reproducible builds across environments. This prevents dependency conflicts and ensures consistent behavior in production deployments.
