**Date:** 2025-07-02  
**Task:** Clean Previous vLLM Installation  
**Duration:** ~3 minutes  
**Status:** COMPLETED  

## Tasks Completed

✅ **vLLM Uninstall**: Attempted `pip uninstall vllm -y` (package not installed)  
✅ **vLLM Flash Attention Uninstall**: Attempted `pip uninstall vllm-flash-attn -y` (package not installed)  
✅ **Flash Attention Uninstall**: Attempted `pip uninstall flash-attn -y` (package not installed)  
✅ **Pip Cache Purge**: Successfully cleared pip cache (18 files, 3.4 MB removed)  
✅ **Clean State Verification**: Confirmed no vLLM packages present  

## Execution Summary

### Uninstall Commands
```bash
# All uninstall commands executed successfully
pip uninstall vllm -y                 # WARNING: Skipping vllm as it is not installed
pip uninstall vllm-flash-attn -y      # WARNING: Skipping vllm-flash-attn as it is not installed  
pip uninstall flash-attn -y           # WARNING: Skipping flash-attn as it is not installed
```

### Cache Management
```bash
pip cache purge                       # Files removed: 18 (3.4 MB)
```

### Verification Result
```bash
pip list | grep vllm || echo "vLLM successfully removed"
# Output: vLLM successfully removed
```

## Current Environment State

### Package Status
- **vLLM**: ❌ Not installed (confirmed clean)
- **vLLM Flash Attention**: ❌ Not installed (confirmed clean)  
- **Flash Attention**: ❌ Not installed (confirmed clean)

### Cache Status
- **Pip Cache**: ✅ Successfully purged (3.4 MB freed)
- **Cache Files Removed**: 18 files

### Environment Readiness
- **Clean State**: ✅ Verified - no vLLM-related packages found
- **Cache Cleared**: ✅ Fresh pip cache for optimal installation
- **Virtual Environment**: ✅ Active and functional

## Observations

### Positive Findings
- Environment was already in clean state (no previous installations to remove)
- Pip cache successfully cleared, freeing 3.4 MB of space
- All commands executed without errors
- Verification confirms optimal state for fresh installation

### Technical Notes
- Uninstall warnings are expected and normal for clean environments
- Cache purge removed accumulated package files from previous operations
- Environment remains stable with only core packages (pip, setuptools, wheel)

### Performance Benefits
- **Storage**: 3.4 MB of cache storage reclaimed
- **Installation**: Fresh cache ensures clean package downloads
- **Reliability**: No conflicting package remnants present

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Dependency Updates**: Proceed with Step 3 to update system dependencies
2. **PyTorch Installation**: Install PyTorch with CUDA support
3. **vLLM Installation**: Fresh installation with optimal environment
4. **Configuration Setup**: Apply centralized configuration management

## Deviations from Plan

None. All cleanup operations proceeded exactly as documented in the task file.
