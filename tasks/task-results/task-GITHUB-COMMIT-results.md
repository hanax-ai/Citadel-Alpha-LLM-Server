### ✅ Repository Verification
- Confirmed remote repository connection to: `https://github.com/hanax-ai/Citadel-Alpha-LLM-Server.git`
- Verified commit was created locally with proper metadata

## Deviations from Plan

### ❌ GitHub Push Failed
- **Issue**: Authentication failure during `git push origin main`
- **Error**: `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address`
- **Cause**: Missing GitHub authentication credentials in environment
- **Impact**: Commit exists locally but not pushed to remote repository

## Observations

### Technical Details
- All project files are now properly version controlled
- Comprehensive commit message follows conventional commit format
- File permissions correctly set for executable scripts
- Repository structure maintains consistency with project organization

### Authentication Requirements
- GitHub push requires either:
  - Personal Access Token (PAT) configuration
  - SSH key authentication
  - GitHub CLI authentication
  - Manual credential input

### Next Steps Required
1. **Immediate**: Configure GitHub authentication credentials
2. **Execute**: `git push origin main` to upload commit to remote repository
3. **Verify**: Confirm all files are visible on GitHub repository

## Files Generated

- [`/tasks/TASK.md`](../TASK.md) - Task tracking document
- [`/tasks/task-results/task-GITHUB-COMMIT-results.md`](./task-GITHUB-COMMIT-results.md) - This result document

## Conclusion

The repository commit task was **partially successful**. All project files have been properly committed to the local Git repository with a comprehensive commit message. The commit includes all planning documents, implementation scripts, validation tools, and configuration files.

**Manual intervention required**: User must provide GitHub authentication credentials to complete the push operation and make the repository changes visible on GitHub.

**Local repository state**: Ready for push - all changes committed and staged for upload to remote repository.
