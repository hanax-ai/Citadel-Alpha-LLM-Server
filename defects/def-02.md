Our goal is to successfully run the planb installation scripts to set up your LLM server. We've been working through the scripts in order, fixing errors as they appear.

What We've Accomplished
So far, we have successfully debugged three major issues in the planb-03-nvidia-driver-setup.sh script:

Solved the Missing Configuration File Error

Problem: The initial script failed because it couldn't find its configuration files in the /opt/citadel/ directory.

Solution: We copied the configuration files from your project folder (~/Citadel-Alpha-LLM-Server-1/configs/) to the correct system path (/opt/citadel/configs/).

Bypassed the "Permission Denied" Logging Error

Problem: The script was caught in a loop. It failed without sudo because it couldn't write a log file, but it was also designed to not run with sudo.

Solution: We edited the script and removed the part of the logging commands (| tee -a "$LOG_FILE") that tried to write to a file. This forces all logs to just appear on the screen and completely bypasses the permission issue.

Identified a Python Dataclass Error

Problem: With the logging issue fixed, the script ran but then failed with a Python TypeError, indicating a syntax error in one of the configuration scripts.

Solution: We identified the cause as fields being in the wrong order in the gpu_settings.py file.

Where We Are Now
We are currently in the middle of fixing the Python error.

Your immediate next step is to edit the /home/agent0/Citadel-Alpha-LLM-Server-1/configs/gpu_settings.py file and reorder the class fields so that any fields without a default value are defined before the fields that have one.

Once you fix that file, the planb-03 script should finally run successfully, allowing us to move on to planb-04.
